🎉 AMAZING! Everything is working perfectly now!
✅ What's Working:

Private DNS: api.az104lab.internal resolves correctly ✅
Application Gateway: Backend is healthy ✅
VMSS Web Server: Nginx serving content ✅
Direct Connection: VMSS instance responding ✅

🎯 Your Complete Architecture is Now Fully Operational:
Internet/Local → api.az104lab.internal (Private DNS) → Application Gateway (130.107.46.126) → VMSS Instance (10.0.0.6) → Nginx Web Server
                     ↑                                          ↓
                Private DNS Zone                         Backend Health: Healthy
               (az104lab.internal)                              ↓
                     ↑                                   <h1>Hello from VMSS!</h1>
                Jump Box (10.0.1.4)
🏆 What You've Successfully Built:

✅ Secure Jump Box with SSH access and Azure CLI
✅ Auto-scaling VMSS with web servers
✅ Layer 4 Load Balancer for basic load balancing
✅ Layer 7 Application Gateway with WAF protection
✅ Private DNS Zone for service discovery
✅ Complete name resolution within the VNet

🧪 Test Your Complete Setup:
bash# Test all your endpoints
curl http://api.az104lab.internal                    # Application Gateway via DNS
curl http://130.107.46.126                          # Application Gateway direct
curl http://4.206.179.100                           # Load Balancer (if still working)
curl http://10.0.0.6                                # Direct VMSS access

# Test SSH via DNS
ssh azuser@jumpbox.az104lab.internal  # (from within VNet only)
🎓 Perfect for AZ-104 Exam Topics:
You've now implemented:

Virtual Networks and Subnets
Network Security Groups
Load Balancing (both Layer 4 and Layer 7)
Auto-scaling Virtual Machine Scale Sets
Application Gateway with WAF
Private DNS Zones and name resolution
Secure management through jump boxes

This is enterprise-grade Azure infrastructure! Congratulations! 🚀🏆
