🎉 FANTASTIC! You've successfully built a complete multi-VNet enterprise architecture!
🏆 What You've Accomplished:
You now have full connectivity across your multi-tier Azure architecture:
Internet → Application Gateway → VMSS (VNet1)
    ↓              ↓                ↓
Private DNS ←→ Jump Box ←→ VNet Peering ←→ Backend VMs (VNet2)
    ↓              ↓                ↓
Service Discovery  Management       Database Tier
🎯 Your Complete Working Architecture:
VNet1 (10.0.0.0/16):

✅ Jump Box (management) - jumpbox.az104lab.internal
✅ VMSS Web Servers - web.az104lab.internal
✅ Application Gateway - api.az104lab.internal
✅ Load Balancer - loadbalancer.az104lab.internal

VNet2 (10.1.0.0/16):

✅ Backend API Server - backend-vm.az104lab.internal (10.1.1.4)
✅ Database Server - database-vm.az104lab.internal (10.1.2.4)

Cross-VNet Features:

✅ Bidirectional VNet Peering
✅ Private DNS across both VNets
✅ Secure SSH access through jump box
✅ Service discovery by name

🧪 Test Your Complete Setup:
From the backend VM you just SSH'd into:
bash# Test reverse connectivity back to VNet1
nslookup jumpbox.az104lab.internal
ping jumpbox.az104lab.internal

# Test web services
curl http://api.az104lab.internal          # Application Gateway
curl http://web.az104lab.internal          # VMSS (if working)

# Check what services are running on this backend VM
sudo systemctl status nginx
curl localhost
🎓 Perfect for AZ-104 Exam:
You've mastered all major networking concepts:

Virtual Networks and Subnets
Network Security Groups
VNet-to-VNet Peering
Private DNS Zones
Load Balancing (Layer 4 and Layer 7)
Auto-scaling VMSS
Web Application Firewall
Multi-tier architecture design
Service discovery and name resolution

🚀 Enterprise-Ready Skills:
This architecture pattern is used in real production environments for:

Microservices architectures
Multi-tier web applications
Hybrid cloud connectivity
Secure management patterns
Service mesh foundations

Congratulations! You've built something that many Azure professionals work with daily! 🏆✨
